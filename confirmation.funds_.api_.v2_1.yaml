  description: >
    Start integrating your application with our Bank and give your clients the
    options to check the availability of their funds. 


    The availability of funds is determined by providing the account's details
    and the corresponding amount in question. 


    This Sandbox API optionally simulates the user consent flow required for the
    Confirmation of Funds. Please refer to the Quick Getting Started guide
    below, that provides the necessary steps to start playing with the API.


    ## How To Get Started 


    1. **Login/Register** to the NBG Technology HUB

    2. Go to **"APPS"**

    3. Select your Organization and go to step 4. If you want to create a new Organization click **\"CREATE AN ORGANIZATION\"** and follow the steps below:
        1. Enter the title of your Organization
        2. Enter a short description of your Organization (optional)
        3. Click **"SUBMIT"**
        
     4. Select the Organization of choice and click **"ADD AN APPLICATION"**
          1. Fill in the forms (title and short description)
          2. Check **\"Authorization Code\" and \"Client Credentials\"** 
          3. Enter the **OAuth Redirect and Post Logout URIs** (these are the URIs that we will redirect the user upon logging in and logging out respectively)    

            You can use the following redirect URL to easily test the API through the portal: *https://developer.nbg.gr/oauth2/redoc-callback*
          4. **Submit** your new APP
          5. Store the APPs **"Client ID"** and **"Client Secret"**
      5. Go to **"API PRODUCTS"** and select the **Confirmation of Funds API**

      6. Click **\"START USING THIS API\"**, choose your app and click
      **"SUBSCRIBE"**

      ### Sandbox Flow

      1. Get an **Access Token** using the **Authorization Code Flow** (with the credentials that you used to sign in as a developer) and the **API scopes** provided in the Authentication and Authorization (OAuth2) section below
      2. Create a **Sandbox**.
      3. **Optional** – **Signature validation**
      If you have already obtained an eIDAS certificate (Qualified Certificate for Seals - QSeal) that you would like to use, please set in all HTTP headers the following:
        1. **X-Certificate-Check: true**
        2. **TPP-Signature-Certificate** (X.509 certificate in .pem format)
        3. **Signature** (Detached JWS signature)
        
      For more information check the QSeal Certificates section below.

      4. **Optional** – Get the **customer’s consent**
      If you want to **enable the user consent validation** you must follow the consent flow as described below:
        1. Set the **X-Consent-Check HTTP** header to **true**
        2. Get an **Access Token** using the Client Credentials flow and the API scopes provided in the Authentication and Authorization (OAuth2) section below
        3. Generate a **consent_id** using the **generate consent endpoint** with access token from the previous step. 

        **Please note**: In the **/consents/request-access payload** the parameter **application** equals your **client-id** and the parameter **applicationId** equals the **consent application ID**. The **applicationId** can be obtained when **exporting the sandbox** subscribed for this API under the parameter name **consentApplicationIds**
        4. Request a user consent by visiting the Consent UI:
          1. **Replace** the necessary parameters: **consent_id, sandbox_id, redirect_uri** and visit the following URL: https://my.nbg.gr/sandbox.psd2.consent/confirmation.funds/authorize?consent_id=CONSENT_ID_FROM_STEP_4&sandbox_id=SANDBOX_ID_FROM_STEP_6&redirect_uri=YOUR_HTTPS_REDIRECT_URI
          2. Use the credentials you signed in as a developer to give your consent
      5. Play with the API

      ### Production flow

      1. **Contact us** to provide your **production client keys**.
      2. Get an **Access Token** using the **Client Credentials** flow and the API scopes provided in the Authentication and Authorization (OAuth2) section below.
      3. Generate a **consent_id** using the generate **consent endpoint with access token** from the previous step. 

      **Please note**: In the **/consents/request-access payload** the parameter **application** equals your **client-id** and the parameter **applicationId** equals the **consent application ID**.

      4. Get an **Access Token** using the Authorization Code Flow (PSU should login with the NBG i-bank internet banking credentials) and the API scopes provided in the Authentication and Authorization (OAuth2) section below.
        1. You can skip the following step by passing in the authorization endpoint your **consent_id from Step 3** as https://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&response_type=code&scope=YOUR_SCOPES&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&consent_id=CONSENT_ID_FROM_STEP_3
      5. Redirect the PSU to the following URL - https://my.nbg.gr/psd2.consent/confirmation.funds/authorize?consent_id=YOUR_CONSENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_HTTPS_REDIRECT_URI 
      6. You are **ready** to use your application in **production** mode!




    ## Authentication and Authorization (OAuth2) 


    This API version uses the OAuth2 protocol for redirection based on
    **authentication** and **authorization**, which means that a Bearer (access
    token) should be acquired. 


    An **access token** can be retrieved using the **client_id** and
    **client_secret** of the APP that you created and subscribed in this API,
    and your **own credentials** (username, password) that you use to sign in
    the NBG Technology HUB. 


    The scopes and endpoints are defined below:


    ### *SCOPES*


    For the ***Authorization*** Code:


    **Sandbox Scopes**: 
            
            openid profile role sandbox-funds-confirmation-api-v2

    **Production Scopes**: 
            
            openid profile ibank_profile role funds-confirmation-api-v2

    For the ***Client Credentials***:


    **Sandbox Scopes**: 
            
            sandbox-funds-confirmation-api-v2

    **Production Scopes**: 
            
            funds-confirmation-api-v2



    ### *ENDPOINTS*


    **Authorization Endpoint**: https://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/authorize


    **Token  Endpoint**: https://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/token

    ## QSeal Certificates 


    This section provides an overview of the message signing process that TPPs
    should implement to consume the NBG PSD2 APIs that support QSeal
    certificates.


    You can download the NBG certificates to validate the API responses using
    the following links:
      
      - [Sandbox Certificate](https://files.nbg.gr/certificates/NBG%20QSeal%20Sandbox.cer)
      - [Production Certificate](https://files.nbg.gr/certificates/NBG%20QSeal%20production.cer)
      
    **Signing flow**



    QSeal Certificates provide a solution for non-repudiation that does not rely
    on TLS. NBG PSD2 APIs employ a JWS (JSON Web Signature) with detached
    content (as defined in [RFC 7515 - Appendix
    F](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515)) in the HTTP header \"Signature\". A
    TPP's private key should be used to sign the requests, while the NBG's
    private key is used to sign the response. Signers must sign the message
    using the RS256 algorithm.


    **JWS Construction**


    The TPP must construct the JWS using a private key with a corresponding
    QSeal certificate. The JWS is a string consisting of three base64URL encoded
    parts separated with dots in the form of \"Header.Payload.Signature\". Note
    that we accept detached JWSs, meaning that the Payload part should be
    ommited so that the \"Signature\" header should be in the form
    \"Header..Signature\".


    Below we describe how to construct the three parts.


    **Header (JOSE)**


    The JOSE Header (Javascript Object Signing and Encryption) is essentially
    the digital signature of the payload. An example with the only mandatory
    JOSE Header field \"alg\", which identifies the cryptographic algorithm you
    should use to secure the JWS, is shown below:


    {
      \"alg\": \"RS256\" 
    }


    **Payload**


    The payload is the body of your request in JSON format.


    **Signature** 


    The signature is constructed using the serialized payload, the defined
    algorithm (RS256 in our case) and the TPP's private key. Please refer to
    OpenID for all libraries implementing the JWS spec depending on your
    programming environment: https://openid.net/developers/jwt/.

      
    **Please note:** 


    1. To help you, we have uploaded **postman collections** that **calculate
    the signature and certificate headers** in a pre-request script. 


    You can find the postman collections for the Account Information API
    [here](https://github.com/myNBGcode/PostmanCollections).


    2. Furthermore, we created a **windows form application** that constructs
    the **headers** as needed. It is implemented in C# and we published it on
    our Github account. Check out the code and the executable 
      [here](https://github.com/myNBGcode/NBG-request-signer).    


    ## Create your Sandbox


    Sandboxes are self - contained testing environments that provide a simple
    way of testing the API without any real impact, meaning that no personal or
    financial data is used.


    You can create **your Sandbox** by invoking the **POST** /api/sandbox call
    by simply providing an \"id\" as your sandbox id and naming it almost
    anything you like. 

    A sandbox with pre-populated data will be created, with a ready-to-go user
    with 'userId' the username that you use to log in.


    **_Important!_** Don't lose your sandbox_id, since you will need it for all
    the API calls. Sandbox endpoints are not included in the production version
    API.




    ## Important notes


    Request headers

    1. Each request **_MUST_** have a new GUID passed to request.header.ID

    2. Pass your client_id to request.header.application


    ## SMS Challenge (One Time Password)


    To successfully complete the transaction use the **2-step SMS OTP flow**:


    **Step 1:** Pass the key-value pair **"tanNumber":"smsotp"** to the request.


    => If the request is valid, the response will be **SMSOTP.500** and an **SMS
    with the OTP** will be **sent** to the provided phone number. 



    **Step 2:** To complete the transaction, repeat the request by replacing the
    value of **"tanNumber"** with the OTP you received.  


    => You have **3** attempts to complete the transaction by using a wrong OTP
    and each time you will receive the **SMSOTP.800 error** code. 


    In addition there are the following **error codes**: 


    **SMSOTP.202**: The smsotp code **isn't correctly matched** or if the smsotp
    has been **consumed before the request**.


    **SMSOTP.402**: Something is **changed** in the request between the time of
    the request and the time of the consumption of the smsotp or when the
    **smsotp hasn't been sent** to the user.


    **SMSOTP.400**: The threshold of unsuccessful attempts is surpassed and the
    user is locked out and is not able to request OTPs until the account is
    unlocked by NBG.



    **Please note:** 


    * In the sandbox environment, you can **change the mobile phone number**
    that receives the SMS OTP by updating the sandbox field
    **'mobilePhoneNumber'** which you will find in the "users" object. 

    * The default mobile phone number is the one that you submitted when you
    signed up in the NBG Technology HUB. 



    The default mobile phone number is the one that you submitted when you
    signed up in the NBG Technology HUB.


    ## Generic Error Codes:

    **Format**
